@TwitterSupport,"We had planned for Fleets to help people feel comfortable joining the conversation in a low-pressure way, but it turns out Fleets were mainly used by those Tweeting the most. So now we're ready to explore other ways for people to share on Twitter. (2/4)"
@TwitterSupport,We learned a lot from Fleets and we’re excited to focus on newer and better ways to start conversations on Twitter. We’re proud of the work so far and have no plans of slowing down. (3/4)
@TwitterSupport,"Taking big chances helps us make the best product possible for you, but it doesn't always work out like we planned. It’s not always easy to say goodbye to a feature like Fleets, but we’re excited to get back to work on what we’ve got planned next: https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets.html… (4/4)"

@BackupKy1e,"Hi @TwitterSupport , I filed a DMCA counter-notification over 10 days ago and never got a notice. This means that my account (@Ky1eWRLD) should have been unsuspended. However, it is still locked. Please unlock my account because it is now in good standing. Case # 0203668923"
@fluffykittensox,I’m impressed that you have actually taken note of what didn’t work and also listened to the populace. Thank you for that it’s appreciated.
@TwitterSupport,

@jmitboyism,#TwitterUnmuteJimin Please unmute Jimin’s name it’s been years already
@nbranche,Interesting. I hope @Twitter doesn’t kill off voice tweets before I get to try it…that feature launched before fleets and I never got around to fleeting
@althel7,احسن، بعضهم كل يوم ينزل كومة تغريدات ويصور تغريداته ويحطها فلييت! باقي يلاحق فيها الناس في الشوارع نشوف تغريداته. وشكله يرسل على قروبات الواتساب روابط تغريداته وفي الحالة على الواتساب
@dumbledong,Hey @twittersupport my business account (580k) was suspended due to false copyright claims @ellebrookeuk . I successfully appealed all claims and was told after 10 business days my account would be reinstated. I still haven’t obtained any response. Please help #0211860185
@TwitterSupport,Thanks for sticking with us. We're experiencing a rise in cases and our team is working quickly to respond as soon as they can.
@Thunder_Owl,Thank You for throwing that out.
@EBOlady,Hope nothing you do deters me from my favorite function: blocking.
@BriEscobarC,"Editar tuits, no es complicado"
@chaoaretasty,Please give me the space back that the fleets took up rather than replace what you show there
@ThomBartley,"Please don’t pull a @mosseri and hit us with a “we’re not longer a short message sharing app”. Insta lost its way because all it does is steal other people’s ideas (Stories = worked, push towards video / shopping doesn’t) Hope you come up with something original / good"
@Alone_Rider1212,Plz add reel option like ig and you tube Thank you
@joelvmills,"I’d like to see recent tweets in time order. When reading Twitter around an activity or event news, sport or whatever I want to see up to date commentary not yesterday’s tweets. The ICYMI function was better than a jumbled chronology."
@nhfabioo,Something is not working on my twitter account! I can't see the most engaged tweets when I click on the TOP section. Instead it shows the most recent ones! Help me!
@Kathleenhamil15,"Fleets, we hardly knew ye..."
@PeacefulPagoda,"Glad to not have the insta stories or snaps, now we just need an rdit button."
@Icebox551,maybe stop removing shit and actually implement an edit tweet
@NaSa2013NaSa,Thank you for undisturbing enduser Best decision you have ever made
@mikequinn_,Open up your API to third party clients like @tweetbot and you’ll get more adaption.
@shawnwenzel,"A feature I would love to see is a ""tweet sunset"" where tweets older than a year or two are only visible to you or people you follow unless you retweet them again. Would prevent trolls from digging up old tweets like recently happened to @itskerrii"
@Cally246,Can we have a way to be able to see interactions between accounts? Like if you click on someone’s profile you can see if you’ve interacted before?
@TwitterSupport,"Hey Cally. Thanks for the suggestion, we'll share this with our larger team for consideration."
@Erick_O_Mokua,"That is a sober,great http://move.How about giving us a character limit of say 250 per tweet instead of somebody doing so many tweets explaining a topical issue?It will be a great move I believe."
@Erick_O_Mokua,"I also want to vouch for the ""Edit"" option feature but the original message will not be deletable but ""If"" one deletes the original message under any edit,then the whole ""Thread"" will simply get deleted."
@CatholicJosh122,An edit button. Now. Signed - LITERALLY. EVERYONE
@MibIH,So maybe now you'll give us the Edit button every Twitter user has been crying out for since day one?
@Chicks126,"To make it ""the best product possible"" add an ""EDIT"" icon. And just accept that people are going to use the word ""fuck"" in their tweets."
@AdamantxYves,Could you let us search through our media galleries when we're trying to post pics and vids? They're never in order when I try.
@SnakeCharmers,You can improve Twitter with an EDIT button. That's number 1.
@redmeister81,Blue ticks for all. Sorted
@SweetyGogoi6,Why my this tweet is unavailable it's not any hate or other words i have used requesting you to please ger my tweet available and the reason why unavailable i have not used any bad word or tweeted any hate speech
@lalita_xsiempr,"Hello, please reactivate my account. is @yacque_espos I was suspended for copyright by mistake"
@TampaWoman1965,Can you provide a system for vaccine and political disinformation?
@kgradyback2life,Edit. Option. One that tracks original tweet so their are always receipts. Please and thank you!
@_garud_a,Give us back Moments for smartphones users.
@kannemaznn,"hello, @TwitterSupport i'm writing to say that my account has been suspended for over a month, it was suspended on 06/02, i've resorted in all possible ways, but i don't get an answer at all, can you do something ? case #0211230447"
@elemsee,"Going by the responses, perhaps you should beef up customer service and responding to suspension issues."
@CerebralPalsite,"How about putting tweets in chronological order and stopping promoted tweets taking up more of my timeline then people I actually want to follow? Oh, I forgot. It’s whatever makes the most money first before what actual users want. Moving on."
@robspodcastmug,Now would be a good time for that edit button
@Lindas_Here,"Here’s a novel idea…..an EDIT button! Even one that only gives you a minute or two to edit your tweet! I know it’s possible, because I had a forum with that feature before. Get with the program twitter!"
@eroipu_yakai,"Hi @TwitterSupport , my account @kusokyomu and @Web26735457 got suspended and it never violated the Twitter rules. I appealed the suspension via the Help Center but obtained no response. It's been a month. Could you please consider and unsuspend it? Case number is #0217540559 Thx."
@all4kame,I want an EDIT button is that too much to ask????
@RayArnold_VVA,Ok
@youichi1215,iPad使えないフリート機能なんていらん
@ohsixoneoh,I just want you to take a chance on an #edit button!
@interknetted,Good decision! Tells that we must experiment with ideas. Shutting what doesn't work and moving on to new ideas.
@elementrus,Explicitly copying a feature from multiple other platforms isn't taking a risk. Why pat yourself on the back for plagiarism?
@michellegraz,Here’s an idea - give us an edit button
@ohayoo2018,"Hey I've been using Twitter since 2008. It's ok.Sometimes things don't go well. You know what, we need edit function. I prefer simpler Twitter as it was a decade ago. It'd be much better for us users to fully control our TL. Don't mess it around. Let's make a better Twitterland!"
@kasparknusper,"Thank you for removing Fleets. That was something no one had asked for. And all reasons for Fleets you mentioned, are nothing what a usual tweet could do too anyway, beside beeing self destroyed, which, again, Noone had asked for."
@_Bkhshi_Amin,Zart!
@MustaphaMugisa,What if before such investment you ran a short survey about the featured customers would desire the most? And then refine based on the voice of the users???
@JR_Bee101,I would very much like to stop seeing peoples likes in my feed.
@bumblebeenush,"Now if you put in more effort into banning racist tweet accounts, that would be much appreciated"
@ReneeNTexas,"Read the room. Quit trying to copy ideas, and make tweets editable. #NotRocketScience"
@Denismskt,Algunos son tan idiotas que tienen de administradores Perú a apologistas del terrorismo.
